## 2024-05-22 - Unauthenticated Webhook Endpoint
**Vulnerability:** The `POST /api/webhook` endpoint allowed unauthenticated users to trigger Discord notifications.
**Learning:** API routes under `/api` are skipped by the global middleware proxy authentication check (`src/proxy.ts`). Route handlers must implement their own authentication checks.
**Prevention:** Always verify authentication (`auth()`) and authorization (e.g., `isAdmin`) inside API route handlers, especially for actions with side effects like sending notifications.
