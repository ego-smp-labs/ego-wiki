# Storyline and narrative of the Ego abyss world
it might help you understand what happened...

## Drifting memories...

You wake up without truly "coming back to life".

No welcome sound. No warm sunlight.
Only a feeling cold like metal touching teeth: *I forgot something very important*.

Your memory didn't disappear — it **drifted**.
Like ash in the wind, like blood washed away by rain, like a name scratched off a grave.

You take another step, and the world takes another step into you.

Vague sounds appear behind your back: breathing, small laughter, whispers calling the exact name you can't remember.
Every time you believe you are "safe", the ground reminds you that: safety is just a lie repeated enough times.

Here, survival is not a miracle. It is... **the new normal**.
You will learn to eat fast, look around, and sleep with your hand ready on your weapon.

Then a time will come when you realize the cruelest thing:

Not you exploring this world.
But this world is exploring your **ego** — layer by layer.

And when the calamity of the Deadly Sins starts knocking at the door,
you will have to answer a question yourself that no one can save you from:

*Are you running from monsters... or running from yourself?*
