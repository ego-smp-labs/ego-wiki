# FAQ

## What about death?

Death does not "wash clean" what you have absorbed.
It only breaks your heartbeat, and pulls you closer to the edge of the abyss.

- If you are **Tier 0**: you are still Tier 0.
- If you are **Tier 1 or higher**: when dying you will be **pulled back to Tier 1** (not falling to Tier 0 anymore).

See Tier details at: **[Tier System](/en/ego-system/02-tier-system)**

## Ego System

### Where does Ego drop from?

Ego is what drops from **PvP** — from the moment a player takes another player's life.

### Why do I kill but don't see Ego drop?

Common reasons:

- **Low tier anti-farm**: high tier player killing tier 0 may **not drop Ego**, to avoid "smashing chickens for eggs".
- **Server protection from repeated farming**: server may enable drop limit mechanism (cooldown by victim / kill streak limit) to block farming.

### What happens after using Ego?

Because Ego is not a tonic — it is a "piece of human" broken off.

When using Ego, you will suffer reactions like:
- Dizziness (Nausea).
- Sudden light/dark (Darkness).
- Inventory shuffle (slots swapped).
- Poison I for 10-15 seconds.

(This is the price of forcing the Ego to "swallow" more sin.)

### What is Dark Ego, and why is everyone afraid?

Dark Ego is a **more toxic, dirtier, more annoying** version of normal Ego.
It is designed to **lock evolution**: you cannot "climb blindly" to the next tier if you haven't passed the corresponding Dark Ego gate.
Besides, Dark Ego also has its own mechanics (e.g., crafting special items, stronger effects, distinct signs).

## Mace

### What is Mace?

Mace is a legendary weapon with destructive power.

### How long does Mace glow after belonging to me?

Mace can attach a **glowing effect for 5 minutes** after you own it, but greater power comes with risks, hunting is what awaits you.

### Can I throw Mace (Q key)?

Mace is designed with restricted drop: **do not allow throwing**, and usually only "slips out" by death rules (depending on mode).

### Can I put Mace in a chest?

There is a **strict-mode** to tighten moving Mace into containers; when strict-mode is on, server will block putting Mace into unauthorized storage places.

## Server

### How to join?

Connect by server IP and join Discord: https://discord.gg/jRqnNbupj4

### I found a bug!

### Which Minecraft version is needed?

Recommended **1.21.11+** and **1.21.130** for PE (newer version implies fewer errors).
