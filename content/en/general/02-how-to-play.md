# How to Play

## 1. The Goal: Ascend the Tiers

Your goal is to increase your **Ego Tier** from 0 to 9. Each tier grants:

| Tier | Health Bonus | Damage Bonus | Notable Unlock |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 0 | +0 HP | +0% | — |
| 1 | +2 HP | +2% | — |
| 2 | +4 HP | +4% | Anti-farming protection |
| 3 | +6 HP | +6% | Soul Stealer skill |
| 4 | +8 HP | +8% | Speed I passive |
| 5 | +10 HP | +10% | Shadow Step, Dark Ego drops |
| 6 | +12 HP | +12% | Titan Skin, Resistance I |
| 7 | +14 HP | +14% | Glowing aura |
| 8 | +16 HP | +16% | Berserk, Strength I |
| 9 | +18 HP | +18% | Abyssal Shriek |


## 2. Getting Ego Fragments

- **Kill another player** in PvP combat
- The victim drops an **Ego Fragment** (Nether Star)
- ⏱️ **Cooldown**: 25 minutes per victim before they can drop again
- 🚫 **Anti-Farming**: Tier 2+ players cannot farm drops from Tier 0 players


## 3. Using the Fragment (The Ritual)

Hold the Ego Fragment and **Right-Click** to consume it.

| Chance | Outcome |
|--------|---------|
| **90%** | Chaos State — survive 10–15s of debuffs to **Tier Up** |
| **5%** | Instant death |
| **5%** | Full heal (blessed) |

### During Chaos State
- Your hotbar items get **shuffled** every few ticks
- You receive **Nausea + Darkness** debuffs
- **Survive = Tier Up!**


## 4. Death & Tier Loss

> ⚠️ Death is punishing in EGO:

- You may **lose a tier** when killed by another player
- Ego items **vanish on death** (by default)
- Use a **Soul Keeper** item to prevent tier loss on your next death
- After respawning, you get **5 minutes of death protection** (no PvP)


## 5. Dark Ego (Advanced)

- **Drop chance**: Only **5%** from Tier 5+ player kills
- Grants **+2–3 tiers** (low tier) or **+1 tier** (high tier)
- **Extremely dangerous**: Wither II, Darkness, Slowness, Weakness for 30s
- Must defeat a Dark Ego holder to pass **Tier 5 Progression Gate**


## 6. Special Items

| Item | Source | Effect |
|------|--------|--------|
| **Ego Fragment** | Kill a player | Consume to attempt tier up |
| **Dark Ego** | 5% from Tier 5+ kills | High-risk, high-reward tier jump |
| **Soul Keeper** | Admin/special drop | Prevents tier loss on death (one use) |


## 7. The End Dimension

🔒 The End is restricted to **Tier 9 players only**. Players below Tier 9 entering the Dragon Fight area will be instantly killed.
