# How to Play

If you are brand new: reading this page is enough to survive the "honeymoon", as for living long… depends on your bravery.

## Start
When joining the server, you start at **Tier 0**.

First things to do:
- Get wood, stone, food.
- Make a bed (if server allows sleeping), set spawn early to avoid marathon running.
- Craft basic armor/weapons before you meet other players.

## Objectives
1. Gather resources.
2. Craft weapons.
3. Fight other players to receive ego power **Ego Fragment**.
4. Upgrade **Tier** to unlock new skills.

## Rules
- No hack/cheat.
- Respect other players.
- PvP is part of the game — be mentally prepared!
