# How To Play

If you are brand new: reading this page is enough to survive the "honeymoon week", whether you live long or not depends on your skill.

## Starting
When joining the server, you start at **Tier 0**.

First things to do:
- Gather wood, stone, food.
- Make a bed (if server allows sleeping), set spawn early to avoid running a marathon.
- Craft basic armor/weapons before you meet other players.

## Goals
1. Gather resources.
2. Craft weapons.
3. Fight other players to receive ego power **Ego Fragment**.
4. Upgrade **Tier** to unlock new skills.

## Rules
- No hacks/cheats.
- Respect other players.
- PvP is part of the game — be prepared!
