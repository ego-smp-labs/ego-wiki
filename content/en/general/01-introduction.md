# Welcome to EGO WIKI

You have just stepped onto the edge of a world that doesn't care if you are "good" or "evil".  
It only cares about one thing: **how long you survive** before your ego cracks.

EgoSMP is where survival is no longer "farming for fun".  
This is the abyss—where the calamity of sin is not a plot twist, but a **schedule**.

In other servers, peace is the default.  
Here, peace is an **illusion** you tell yourself to sleep well.

## What are you walking into?

This world operates on a hard-to-swallow truth:  
when blood spills on the ground, what awakens is not just hatred—but the **deadly sins** lying dormant within humans.

You start as an ordinary person.  
But the longer you exist, the more you are forced to choose: keep yourself, or let your ego slide deep—and accept the consequences.

Don't expect "die then respawn as if nothing happened".  
In EgoSMP, death is a door, and behind it there is always something waiting for you to pay the price.

## How should newcomers survive?

### Philosophy of the EGO world

EgoSMP revolves around a simple but hard-to-swallow question:

**“When pushed to the edge, who are you?”**

You can start as an ordinary person. But this world won't let you stand still.  
The longer you live, the more you are forced to choose: keep yourself, or let your ego slide deep—and accept the consequences.

## Underground rules of the abyss (read to stay sane)

- Trusting people is a skill, not a virtue.
- Combat does not "happen naturally" — it is *summoned* by the system and greed.
- Surviving in the world of sin will eventually become obvious… and that is when you strictly start becoming scary.

## Drifting memories...

There are souls that die and rest in peace.  
But in EgoSMP, death might just be the beginning of a cycle of punishment—where you have to pull yourself out of the darkness, or be swallowed whole by it.

Calamity does not fall from the sky — it rises from within humans. 
Every bloodstain, every time you survive, is an invitation for **The Deadly Sin** to awaken and call your name. 
And in the middle of this sinful world, only **Ego** keeps you "human"… or pushes you to become what you used to fear.

## Message before you step down

EgoSMP does not promise "absolute fairness".  
EgoSMP promises "clear consequences".

You get stronger by winning, and you learn lessons by failing.  
If you are stubborn enough, smart enough, cruel enough when needed and awake enough when chaotic…

Explore — and become the strongest warrior.

But remember carefully:  
**the abyss does not swallow the weak… it swallows the naive.**
