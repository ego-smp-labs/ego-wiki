# Welcome to the Abyss (Ego Wiki)

You have just stepped onto the edge of a world that does not care if you are "good" or "evil".
It only cares about one thing: **how long you live** before your ego cracks.

EgoSMP is where survival is no longer "farming for fun".
This is the abyss—where the calamity of sin is not a plot twist, but a **schedule**.

In other servers, peace is default.
Here, peace is an **illusion** you tell yourself to sleep well.

## What are you stepping into?

This world operates on a bitter truth:
when blood spills on the ground, what awakens is not just hatred—but the **deadly sins** lying dormant inside humans.

You start as a normal person.
But the longer you exist, the more you are forced to choose: keep yourself, or let your ego slide deep—and accept the consequences.

Don't expect "respawn like nothing happened".
In EgoSMP, death is a door, and behind it, something is always waiting for you to pay the price.

## How to survive as a newcomer?

### Philosophy of the Ego World

EgoSMP revolves around a simple but hard-to-swallow question:

**“When pushed to the edge, who are you?”**

You might start as a normal person. But this world won't let you stand still.
The longer you live, the more you are forced to choose: keep yourself, or let your ego slide deep—and accept the consequences.

## Unspoken Rules of the Abyss (read so you don't look stupid)

- Trust is a skill, not morality.
- Combat doesn't "naturally happen" — it is *called* by the system and greed.
- Surviving in a sinful world will eventually become obvious... and that's when you start becoming truly scary.

## Drifting Memories...

Some souls die and rest in peace.
But in EgoSMP, death might just be the start of a punishment loop—where you pull yourself out of darkness, or get swallowed whole.

Calamity doesn't fall from the sky — it rises from inside humans.
Every bloodstain, every time you survive, is an invitation for **Deadly Sins** to wake up and call your name.
And in this sinful world, only **Ego** keeps you "human"... or pushes you into something you used to fear.

## Message before you step down

EgoSMP doesn't promise "absolute fairness".
EgoSMP promises "clear consequences".

You get stronger by winning, and you learn lessons by losing.
If you are stubborn enough, smart enough, cruel enough when needed and awake enough when chaotic...

Explore — and become the strongest warrior.

But remember carefully:
**the abyss does not swallow the weak... it swallows the naive.**
