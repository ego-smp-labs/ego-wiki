# Welcome to EGO WIKI

Ego is a **PvP evolution system** where you gain **Tier** (level 0–9) by defeating other players and consuming their **Ego Fragments**.

## Why Play?

- 🔥 Higher Tier = More powerful (bonus HP + damage)
- ⚡ Unlock special passive abilities (Speed, Resistance, Glow, Berserk…)
- ☠️ But beware — **death has real consequences**: you can lose your tier!

## Quick Start

1. **Kill another player** — they drop an Ego Fragment (25 min cooldown)
2. **Right-click** the Ego Fragment to consume it
3. **Survive the Chaos State** (10–15 seconds of debuffs + inventory shuffle)
4. If you survive → **Tier Up!**

## Risks

> ⚠️ Using an Ego Fragment is dangerous:
> - **5% chance** of instant death
> - **5% chance** of full heal (blessing)
> - **90% chance** of Chaos State

## Death Consequences

- You may **lose your tier** on death (unless protected by Soul Keeper)
- Ego items **vanish on death** by default (server configurable)
- High-tier players emit a **glowing aura** — everyone can see you!
