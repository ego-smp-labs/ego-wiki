# Storyline and plot of the Ego abyss world
it might help you understand what happened...

## Drifting memories...

You wake up without really "coming back to life".

No welcome sound. No warm sunlight.  
Only a feeling cold like metal touching teeth: *I forgot something very important*.

Your memory didn't disappear — it **drifted**.  
Like ash in the wind, like a bloodstain washed away by rain, like a name scratched off a tombstone.

You take another step, and the world takes another step into you.

Vague sounds appear behind your back: breathing, small laughter, whispers calling the exact name you can't remember.  
Every time you believe you are "safe", the ground reminds you: safety is just a lie repeated enough times.

Here, survival is not a miracle. It is… **the new normal**.  
You will learn to eat quickly, look ahead and behind, and sleep with your hand ready on the weapon.

Then there will be a time you realize the cruelest thing:

Not that you are exploring this world.  
But that this world is exploring **your ego** — layer by layer.

And when the calamity of the Deadly Sins starts knocking,
you will have to answer a question yourself that no one can save you from:

*Are you running away from monsters… or running away from yourself?*
