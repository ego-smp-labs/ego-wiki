# Frequently Asked Questions

## Ego System

### Can I lose my tier when I die?
**Yes.** When killed by another player, you risk losing a tier. Use a **Soul Keeper** to prevent tier loss (one-time use).

### Do Ego items drop when I die?
By default, Ego items **vanish on death** — they are destroyed, not dropped on the ground. This is configurable by the server admin.

### Can I drop Ego items manually (Q key)?
**No.** Ego items are protected — you cannot drop them manually.

### Why didn't I get an Ego drop after a kill?
Possible reasons:
1. **Cooldown**: 25-minute cooldown per victim
2. **Anti-Farming**: Tier 2+ players cannot farm Tier 0 players
3. **Same victim**: 30-minute cooldown for repeat kills on the same player

### What is the Dark Ego Progression Gate?
To reach **Tier 5 or above**, you must first defeat a player who holds Dark Ego. This ensures high-tier players have actually fought against other strong players.


## Mace

### How long does the Mace glow last after crafting?
**5 minutes** (300 seconds). During this time, everyone can see your location.

### Can I store the Mace in a chest?
Only if **Strict Mode** is disabled. When Strict Mode is ON, the Mace can ONLY be in your inventory, on an anvil, or on an enchanting table.

### What happens when I pick up or craft the Mace of Chaos?
You receive a **self-curse**: 10 seconds of Wither effect + 10 seconds of inventory shuffle. This is the price of wielding chaos.
