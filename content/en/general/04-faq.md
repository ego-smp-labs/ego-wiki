# Frequently Asked Questions

## What about Death?

Death doesn't "wash away" what you absorbed.
It only breaks your heartbeat, and pulls you closer to the edge.

- If you are **Tier 0**: you remain Tier 0.
- If you are **Tier 1 or higher**: when you die you will be **pulled back to Tier 1** (no longer drop to Tier 0).

See Tier details at: **[Tier System](/en/ego-system/tier-system)**

## Ego System

### Where does Ego drop from?

Ego is what drops from **PvP** — from the moment one player takes another player's life.

### Why do I kill but see no Ego drop?

Common reasons:

- **Low tier anti-farm**: high tier players killing tier 0 might **not drop Ego**, to avoid "crushing chicks for eggs".
- **Server protection against repetitive farming**: server might have drop limit mechanisms (cooldown per victim / kill streak limit) to block farming.

### What happens after using Ego?

Because Ego is not a tonic — it is a "piece of person" broken off.

When using Ego, you will suffer reactions like:
- Dizziness (Nausea).
- Sudden Light/Dark (Darkness).
- Inventory Shuffle (inventory slots scrambled).
- Poison I for 10-15 seconds.

(This is the price of forcing Ego to "swallow" more sin.)

### What is Dark Ego, and why is everyone afraid of it?

Dark Ego is a **more toxic, dirtier, more annoying** version of normal Ego.
It is designed to **lock evolution**: you cannot "climb blindly" to the next tier without passing the corresponding Dark Ego gate.
Additionally, Dark Ego has its own mechanisms (e.g., crafting special items, stronger effects, distinct signs).

## Mace

### What is Mace?

Mace is a legendary weapon with destructive power.

### How long does Mace glow after belonging to me?

Mace might attach a **glowing effect for 5 minutes** after you possess it, but greater power comes with risks, hunting is what awaits you.

### Can I throw away Mace (Q key)?

Mace is designed with restricted drop: **throwing is not allowed**, and usually only "slips out" upon death rules (depending on mode).

### Can I store Mace in a chest?

There is a **strict-mode** to tighten moving Mace into containers; when strict-mode is on, server will block putting Mace into unauthorized storage places.

## Server

### How to join?

Connect using server IP and join Discord: https://discord.gg/jRqnNbupj4

### I found a bug!

Report in Discord in channel #bug-reports for the team to handle quickly.

### What Minecraft version is needed?

Recommend **1.21.11+** and **1.21.130** for PE (newer versions have fewer bugs).
