# 05 — Auxiliary Features

These are "add-on" features of EgoSMP: not changing the core gameplay, only making the experience **smoother, cleaner, and distinctively terrifying**.

---

## 1) Smooth Night Skipping

When **at least 50%** of players in the *same world* sleep, the night will be skipped with a smooth transition to the new day.
No more one person sleeping while nine others "watch the night" like they are cursed.

**Note**: This is a rhythmic "night skip", not an instant *snap* to morning.

---

## 2) Grass Paths

Walking on **grass paths** will be slightly faster, enough to make "paths" something worth building.
In EgoSMP, paths are not just for convenience — they are traces of the living.

## 3) Better Harvesting

Right-click on ripe crops to **harvest and replant immediately**.
Receive **1–3** products, with a higher chance to get more.
If the crop has a separate "seed-item", the system will **not drop seeds** as inventory trash.

## 4) Creeper Protection (with taste)

A Creeper blowing up half a house is heart-stopping, but disabling explosions completely is... bland.
So there is a protection mechanism with "taste": limits destruction, and **rebuilds the area after explosion** in a visually satisfying way.

<sub><i>Caption: It still explodes — but the world doesn't allow it to steal all your effort.</i></sub>

</div>

## 5) Carry On

Allows **carrying** small mobs by:
- Hold sneak + right-click with an empty hand to pick up, right-click to place down.

- This mechanism usually comes with a limit "only carry 1 thing at a time" and may slow down the carrier.

## Inspiration

- Vane: QoL plugin suite but still lore-friendly/vanilla-friendly.
- Carry On: mechanism to pick/carry mobs and some block-entities with empty hands.
