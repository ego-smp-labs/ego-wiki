# 05 — Add-on Features

These are EGOSMP’s “support” features: they don’t replace the core gameplay, they only make the experience **smooth, clean, and frightening in a subtle way**.  
---

## 1) Smooth Night Skipping

When **at least 50%** of players in the *same world* are in bed, the night is skipped with a smooth transition into the next day.  
No more “one person sleeps, nine people keep watch” like the night itself is a curse.

*Note:* A paced night skip — not a sudden *snap* to morning.

## 2) Footprints on the Grass

Walking on **grass paths** makes you slightly faster—just enough to make roads worth building.  
In EGOSMP, a road isn’t just convenience — it’s proof someone kept living.

## 3) Better Harvesting (Right-click harvesting)

Right-click a fully grown crop to **harvest and replant instantly**.  
You get **1–3** drops, with a higher chance to receive more than one item.  
If the crop has a distinct seed-item, the system **won’t drop seeds** to clutter your inventory.

## 4) Creeper Protection (with style)

A creeper deleting half your house is pain, but disabling explosions completely is… lame.  
So this protection is done “with style”: reduced destruction, and **rebuilding after the blast** in a way that still looks clean.

<sub><i>The blast still happens — your work doesn’t get erased.</i></sub>

## 5) Carrying animals (Carry On)

You can **lift/carry** small mobs using:
- Hold sneak + right-click with empty hands to lift, right-click to place.
- Usually limited to “carry one thing at a time”, with optional slowness while carrying.

## Inspirations

- Vane: QoL features that remain lore-friendly and vanilla-friendly.
- Carry On: lifting/carrying mobs and certain block-entities with empty hands.
