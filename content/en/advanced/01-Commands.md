# Rituals (Commands)
In EgoSMP, commands are not tools — they are rituals to commune with the system.

| Ritual | Description | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `/ego` | Open the Ego status menu (tier, stats, progress). | Essential to track your corruption. |
| `/ego info` | Inspect your own stats or another's. | Know yourself, know your enemy. |
| `/macee info` | Check if the Legendary Mace has been claimed. | The unique relic. |
