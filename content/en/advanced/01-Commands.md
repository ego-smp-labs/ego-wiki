# Rituals (Commands)
In EgoSMP, commands are not tools; they are rituals to communicate with the system.

| Ritual | Description | Note |
|---|---|---|
| `/ego` | Open Ego Status panel (view tier, stats). | Important to track corruption. |
| `/macee info` | Check if the Legendary Mace has an owner. | Unique artifact. |
