# Cursed Crafting Table

The Cursed Table is a special crafting station that uses **soul energy** to forge powerful cursed items.

## Obtaining a Cursed Table

Cursed Tables are placed in the world and are persistent — they remember their soul charges across server restarts.

## Table Layout

The Cursed Table opens a **54-slot GUI** with:

- **3×3 Input Grid** — place your ingredients here
- **Result Slot** — shows the forging output
- **Soul Ring** — 12 indicator slots showing charged/empty souls
- **Charge Button** — sacrifice 1 Tier to charge a soul
- **Info Slot** — displays current soul count
- **Wiki Button** — links to this wiki page

## Soul System

Each Cursed Table can hold up to **12 souls** (configurable). Souls are consumed when forging cursed recipes.

### Charging Souls

To charge a soul:
1. Click the **⚡ Charge Soul** button
2. You will lose **1 Tier** and take **1.5 hearts of damage**
3. One empty soul slot will be filled

### Soul Consumption

Each cursed recipe requires a certain number of souls. When you forge an item, the required souls are consumed from the table.

## Forging Process

1. Place ingredients in the 3×3 grid
2. If the recipe is valid, the result appears in the result slot
3. Click the result to forge — souls are consumed and the item is created
4. Your inventory is shuffled after forging (chaos mechanic)

## Recipes

Cursed recipes define special items that can only be crafted at the Cursed Table. These include:

- **Sin Hearts** — required to awaken sins
- **Container Hearts** — special storage items
- **Chaos Mace** — legendary weapon

> **Note:** Regular crafting recipes can also be discovered at the Cursed Table for convenience.
