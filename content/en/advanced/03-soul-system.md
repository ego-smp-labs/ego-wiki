# Memory Fragments (Soul Grave)

Death is not the end, but a leaving behind.
When the soul leaves the body, a part of your memory condenses into a **Grave**.

- **Duration**: 5 minutes.
- **Mechanism**: You can return to retrieve what resides there. But beware, others can also plunder these memory fragments.
- **Advice**: "Hurry up, or lose it all."
- **Note**: Some special items cannot stay in the grave, like the Mace -> they will be dropped outside.
