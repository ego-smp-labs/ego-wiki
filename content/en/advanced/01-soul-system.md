# Soul Echoes (Memory Shards)

Death is not the end, merely a separation.
When your body fails, a part of your memory congeals into a **Grave**.

- **Lifespan**: Remains for **5 minutes**.
- **Mechanic**: You can return to reclaim your lost memories (items). However, be warned: anyone can plunder these remnants.
- **Advice**: "Run, or lose everything."
