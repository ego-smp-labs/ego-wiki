# World Rules

## 1. Sealed Artifacts
The Abyss rejects the existence of some powers that are too great or chaotic.

- **Banned/Restricted items**: End Crystal, TNT Minecart.
- **Limit**: Mace is restricted (Only 1).
- **Reason**: To balance chaos. A world destroyed too quickly is not fun to rule.

## 2. Sanctuary
The Spawn area is protected by an ancient barrier. No blood spilled here. The only place to breathe peacefully.

## 3. The End (Cursed Realm)
The final dimension is heavily cursed. Anyone step foot in there will meet instant death. Do not challenge death.
