# World Rules

## 1. Sealed Artifacts (The Forbidden)
The Abyss rejects existence of powers too chaotic or destructive.

- **Restricted Items**: End Crystals, TNT Minecarts.
- **Limited Relics**: The **Mace** is unique (Limit: 1).
- **Reason**: To maintain the balance of chaos. A world destroyed too quickly is no fun to rule.

## 2. Sanctuary (Peaceful Zone)
The Spawn area is protected by an ancient barrier. Here, no blood shall be spilled. This is the only place you can breathe freely.

## 3. The End (Cursed Dimension)
The final dimension is heavily cursed. Any soul daring to enter faces **instant death**. Do not challenge the inevitable.
