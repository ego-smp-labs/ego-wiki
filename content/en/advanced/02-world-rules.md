# World Rules

## 1. Sealed Artifacts
The Abyss rejects the existence of powers too great or too chaotic.

- **Banned/Restricted Items**: End Crystal, TNT Minecart.
- **Limit**: Mace is restricted (Unique — Only 1).
- **Reason**: To balance the chaos. A world destroyed too quickly is no fun to rule.

## 2. Sanctuary
The Spawn area is protected by an ancient barrier. Here, no blood is allowed to spill. This is the only place you can breathe in peace.

## 3. The End (Cursed Realm)
The final dimension is heavily cursed. Anyone stepping foot in there will meet an instant, gruesome death. Do not try to challenge the Reaper.
