# Abyss Punishment (Combat Log)

In EGOSMP, fleeing from combat is not an option. The Abyss watches every fight.

## What is Combat Log?
If you disconnect (quit data game) while in combat (taking or dealing damage with another player), you are considered to be **Combat Logging**.

## The Punishment
If you log out during combat, the **Abyss Punishment** awaits you upon your return:

1.  **Instant Death**: You will die immediately, dropping all your items.
2.  **Tier Reset**: Your Ego Tier will be **RESET to Tier 1**.
3.  **Abyss Torture**:
    - When you rejoin, you will be frozen and lifted into the air.
    - You will be impaled by dark spikes.
    - You will suffer **Weakness** and **Blindness** for a short duration.

> **Warning**: Do not unplug or alt-f4 during a fight. The Abyss does not care about connectivity issues.
