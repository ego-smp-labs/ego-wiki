# Abyss Punishment (Combat Log)

In EgoSMP, fleeing from battle is not an option. The Abyss always watches every fight.

## What is Combat Log?
If you disconnect (exit game) while in combat state (dealing or receiving damage from another player), you are considered **Combat Logging**.

## Punishment
If you exit the game while fighting, **Abyss Punishment** awaits you upon return:

1.  **Instant Death**: You will die immediately, dropping all items.
2.  **Reset Tier**: Your Ego Tier will be **RESET to Tier 1**.
3.  **Torture of the Abyss**:
    - When you rejoin, you will be frozen and lifted into the air.
    - You will be pierced by dark spikes.
    - You will suffer **Weakness** and **Blindness** for a short time.

> **Warning**: Do not pull the plug or Alt-F4 while fighting. The Abyss does not care about your connection reason.
