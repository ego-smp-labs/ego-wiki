# Abyssal Forging

The creations of the Abyss cannot be forged by mortal means. They demand time, and a gamble.

- **Rule**: When crafting powerful **Relics** (e.g., the **Mace**), the forging process is extended (e.g., 5 minutes).
- **The Cost**: The location of the forge is **revealed** to the entire server. You cannot retrieve the item until the ritual completes.
- **Risk**: If killed or the forge is destroyed? Total loss.
