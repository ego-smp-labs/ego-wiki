# Memory Fragments

The most powerful Shards cannot be created from tangible materials alone. Instead, you must re-experience the very sensation that eroded the souls of the **Great Sinners**.

By proving your resonance with their egos, you can harvest **Memory Fragments**, which are then fused into weapons.

<ItemCard id="blood-wolfs-memory-fragment" name="Blood Wolf's Memory Fragment" image="/wiki/items/memory_huyet_lang.png" rarity="rare">

*The Blood Wolf was once a creature of the deep forest, but his thirst for blood clouded his reason. Now, he lingers in a state of Chaos, continuously drinking endless streams of blood to heal wounds that never close.*

### Method of Summoning
1. The player must activate Ego to enter the **Chaos** state.
2. While this state is active, the player needs to continuously use **10 Instant Health Potions**.
3. Drinking too many healing potions in a short time will resonate with the **Blood Wolf's thirst for blood**, causing his Memory Fragment to drop at the player's location.

> **Note:** You can drink or splash potions, but it must be completed before the Chaos duration ends (15 seconds).

*The Mad Sound was exiled in the deep Ancient City. His mind merged with the Sculk, creating deadly echolocation sounds that pierce the soul.*

### Method of Summoning
1. You must find an area containing a **Sculk Shrieker**.
2. Activate Ego to enter the **Chaos** state.
3. While in Chaos, the player must **die** in close proximity (5 block radius) to a Sculk Shrieker block.
4. Your bloody death in Chaos will awaken the Shrieker block. There is a **50% chance** the Shrieker block will explode, shatter, and release the **Mad Sound's Memory Fragment**.

## ⏳ Universal Cooldown Rules

The will of the Sinners is heavy and cannot be constantly abused.

> [!WARNING]
> All players on the server share a **3-Day (72 real-life hours) Global Cooldown** for each type of Memory Fragment!

- If you or someone else has just awakened the Blood Wolf's Memory Fragment, **no other player on the server** can use that method to drop it again until 3 days have passed.
- Independent queues: The cooldown for Blood Wolf and Sonic Boom are tracked separately.

## Practical Applications

Memory Fragments are **absolutely mandatory** ingredients in cursed forging recipes to create the seeds of power representing these two Sinners.

1. Embed the **Blood Wolf** Memory Fragment at the center of the Cursed Table to forge the [Blood Wolf Shard (Bloodlust)](#).
2. Embed the **Sonic Boom** Memory Fragment at the center of the Cursed Table to forge the [Sonic Boom Shard (Cuồng Thanh)](#).
