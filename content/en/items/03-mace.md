# Legendary Mace

In EgoSMP, Mace is not a weapon.
It is **a sentence** — and anyone who touches it is **visible** to the whole server.

There are two variants. Both dangerous. But only one of them is *intended*.

---

## Mace of Power

> *"The wielder needs no reason. Its existence is the reason."*

Legendary weapon with pure destructive power.

### Power
- **Max Damage** — increases heavily with height when attacking (Ground Slam)
- **Glowing**: Owner is marked Glowing for 5 minutes — whole server knows where you are
- **Hunted**: When Mace appears, you become a **target** for everyone

### Rules
- Cannot be stored in chest or container
- Drops outside upon death (not in grave)
- Forged at [Cursed Table](/en/items/cursed-crafting) — see [recipes](/en/items/cursed-recipes#mace-of-power)

> ⏳ **Forging time: 5 minutes** — location revealed to server. A moment late is losing all.

---

## Mace of Chaos

> *"Once Mace of Power was copied… and that copy refused to be a copy."*

They say it wanders the server like a **glitch omen** — a crack in reality.

### Power
- **Damage**: Equivalent to [Mace of Power](#mace-of-power), but exchanged for Chaos
- **Chaos (Combat)**: 5% chance to cause **inventory shuffle** to victim for 10 seconds
- **Anonymous**: Death message may **hide killer's name** — victim doesn't know who killed them
- **Self-Curse**: Upon finishing forge or picking up → incur **Wither II** + inventory shuffle

### Rules
- Same rules as Mace of Power: no chest storage, drops on death
- Forged at [Cursed Table](/en/items/cursed-crafting) — see [recipes](/en/items/cursed-recipes#mace-of-chaos)

> ⏳ **Forging time: 10 minutes** — double that of Mace of Power. Double the risk.

> *"The Mace does not choose the strongest. It chooses the one who **dares to keep** it the longest."*
