# Mace (Power & Chaos)

In EGOSMP, Mace is not a weapon.  
It is **an event** — and anyone who touches it is “seen” by the entire server.

There are 2 variations:
- [**Mace of Power** — Mace of Power: “original” — straight power, whoever holds it becomes the target.](#mace-of-power)
- [**Mace of Chaos** — Mace of Chaos: “error” — chaos, curse.](#mace-of-chaos)

## Mace of Power

Legendary weapon with destructive power.

### Strength
- **Damage**: Extremely large, increases strongly with height when attacking.
- **Combat effect**: Ground Slam.
- **Effect when possessed**: Glows for 5 minutes.

### Property law
- When Mace appears, the server can **mark the owner** to create a hunt.

## Mace of Chaos

It is said that once the Mace of Power was “copied”… and that clone refused to be a copy.  
From then on, Mace of Chaos wandered around the server like an omen of error.

### Strength
- **Damage**: Is a copy of [Mace of Power](#mace-of-power), but at the cost of Chaos.
- **Chaos (Combat)**: 10% causes **shuffle inventory** of the victim for a few seconds.
- **Anonymity**: Death messages can **anonymize the killer**.
- **Curse (Self-Curse)**: When forged or picked up, it can cause **wither II** and chaos.

Mace doesn't choose the strongest. It chooses the one who **dares to keep** it the longest.
