# Relics

Not everything you pick up is "loot".
Some things are **relics** — ruins left behind after souls are ground down to the bone.

In EgoSMP, items are divided into two origins:

---

## Normal Crafting

Familiar recipes — vanilla crafting table, furnace, anvil.
Nothing unusual. No price to pay.

This is where you create **base materials** — the first bricks before stepping into the abyss:

- **Tainted Ego** — Ego Fragment + Netherite Ingot
- **Cursed Crafting Table** — Dark Ego + Crafting Table + Netherite + Obsidian

## Abyssal Forging

> *"Not everyone is worthy to touch darkness. But darkness is always ready to touch you."*

Creations of the abyss **cannot** be crafted in the usual way.
They need time. They need soul. And a **gamble**.

Sacrifice is a special branch — born from soul sacrifice at the [Cursed Table](/en/items/cursed-crafting). They are not weapons, not armor. They are **catalysts** — things that activate powers hidden in the abyss.

### There are four types:

- **[Ego Shards](/en/ego-system/ego-shards)** — relics of those who left their ego behind
- **[Ancient Artifacts](/en/items/artifacts)** - weapons carrying the ego of the creator
- **[Ego Pact](/en/items/ego-pact)** - Power boost by sacrificing ego
- **[Heart of Sins](/en/ego-system/sins)** — Ancient power of the abyss

### Forging Characteristics
- ⏳ **Time**: Powerful Relics need extended forging time (5–10 minutes)
- 📍 **Exposed**: Forge location is **broadcasted to the whole server** — you become prey
- 🔒 **Locked**: Item is locked until completion
- 💀 **Risk**: forged items cannot be stored, can only be **absorbed**

> *"The abyss does not give power. It lends — and the interest is the soul."*

## Chaos Effect (Inventory Shuffle)

When using **[Ego](/en/items/ego-items)** or **[Dark Ego](/en/ego-system/dark-ego)** items:
- **Entire Inventory** (both hotbar and bag) will be **randomly shuffled**.
- This is a reminder: power always comes with loss of control.

---

## Item Stacking

Some items like **Ego** and **Dark Ego** cannot be **stacked** (max **1 per slot**).
Saves bag space? No. It means every time you use one, you feel the weight.
