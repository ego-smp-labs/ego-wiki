# Relics

Not everything you pick up is "loot".
Some items are **relics** — things left behind after souls have been eroded.

## Relics in this directory

- [**Might of Power** — Mace of Power](/en/items/mace#mace-of-power)
- [**Mace of Chaos** — Mace of Chaos](/en/items/mace#mace-of-chaos)
- [**Ego Ruins** — Ego Items](/en/items/ego-items)
- [**Dark Self Contract** — Dark Ego](/en/ego-system/dark-ego)


## Reading suggestions (to avoid picking up "curses")

- Want to understand foundation before "fallen": read **Ego Ruins**.
- Want to deal damage and create drama: read **Mace** pages.
- Want to survive long in the world of sin: read **Armor** first.
