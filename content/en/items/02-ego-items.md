# Ego Items

Every time a soul is worn away, it leaves **fragments** — relics of an ego that once existed.
This is not loot. This is the **skeleton** of the fallen.

## Ego Fragment

> *"Every shard is a memory severed."*

The pure remnant of a soul. The core energy source for **upgrading your Tier**.

- **Origin**: Drops when you kill another player (PvP kill)
- **Usage**: Use directly to increase Tier
- **Property**: Bound to the victim — only the killer can use it

## Dark Ego

> *"There are things you shouldn't touch. But you touched them anyway."*

The **corrupted** version of Ego Fragment. More powerful, but cursed.

- **Origin**: Rare drop (5%) from Tier 5+ victims, or 100% drop from Tier 5+ if you're the killer
- **Usage**: Used to upgrade Tier 5+ or as ingredient at [Cursed Crafting](/en/items/cursed-crafting)
- **Risk**: **10% instant death** chance on use
- **Effects on pickup**: Wither + inventory shuffle for 10 seconds
- **Gating**: From Tier 5+ you are **forced to defeat** a Dark Ego holder to evolve

## Tainted Ego

> *"Purity mixed with darkness. The result? Something that belongs to no one."*

An Ego Fragment that lost its purity after being fused with Netherite.

- **Recipe (Normal Craft)**: Ego Fragment + Netherite Ingot (Shapeless)
- **Primary use**: Core ingredient for [Cursed Crafting](/en/items/cursed-crafting) recipes
- **⚠️ Right-clicking directly** → **instant death**:
  - Drops a **Dark Ego** (victim = yourself)
  - **Resets Tier to 1** + clears all equipped Shards
  - Applies **Wither I** to entities within 5 blocks
- **Limitation**: Non-stackable — cannot be placed in containers

## Soul Keeper

> *"Once. Only once. Then it turns to ash."*

A protective charm that shields your Tier when you die. Like a Totem of Undying — but for **your soul**.

- **Usage**: On death, Tier is not lost (single use, self-destructs)
- **Craft**: Forged at the [Cursed Crafting Table](/en/items/cursed-crafting) — see [recipes](/en/items/cursed-recipes)
- **Property**: Non-stackable, cannot be placed in containers

> *"The abyss gives you a second chance. Don't expect a third."*
