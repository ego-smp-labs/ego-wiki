# Cursed Crafting Table

> *"Places like this don't craft items. They craft **curses**."*

The Cursed Table is the only station capable of forging Artifacts from the abyss. It runs on **soul energy** — and every soul has a price.

---

## How to Build

The Cursed Table does not generate naturally. You must **build it yourself**.

**Recipe (Shaped Crafting):**

| | Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Row 1 | | Ego Soul | |
| Row 2 | Obsidian | Crafting Table | Obsidian |
| Row 3 | | Netherite Ingot | |

**Output**: Cursed Crafting Table × 1

> Place it down and **right-click** to open the interface.

---

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Soul Bank** | 10 slots on the left showing souls (gray = empty, purple = charged) |
| **⚡ Charge Button** | Sacrifice 1 Tier to charge a soul |

## Soul System

Each Cursed Table holds a maximum of **10 souls**.
Souls are consumed when forging [cursed recipes](/en/items/cursed-recipes).

### Charging Souls

1. Click the **⚡ Charge Soul** button
2. You lose **1 Tier** and take **1.5 hearts damage**
3. An empty soul slot is filled

> *"Every soul charged is a piece of your ego you'll never get back."*

### Consuming Souls

Each recipe requires a specific number of souls. When you retrieve the result, the required souls are **devoured** — non-refundable.

## Abyssal Forging

This is a special forging mechanic for **High-Tier Artifacts** (Mace, Ego Shards...).
Unlike normal crafting, Abyssal Forging is a **gamble against time**.

### Process

1. Place ingredients in the 3×3 grid
2. If the recipe is valid → result appears
3. Click result → **forging process begins** (cannot be cancelled)
4. Wait for the duration → retrieve product

### The Price

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ⏳ **Time** | Powerful artifacts take 5–10 minutes to forge |
| 📍 **Exposure** | Forge location is **broadcast to the entire server** |
| 🔒 **Lock** | Items cannot be removed until complete |
| 💀 **Total Loss** | If killed or forge destroyed → lose all ingredients + souls |

> *"Creations of the abyss cannot be made the normal way. They take time, and a gamble."*
