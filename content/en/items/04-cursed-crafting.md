# Cursed Crafting Table

> *"This place does not craft items. It crafts **curses**."*

The Cursed Table is the only crafting station that can forge Relics from the abyss. It runs on **soul energy** — and every soul has a price.

## How to Create Cursed Table

The Cursed Table does not appear naturally. You must **manually** build it.

**Recipe (Normal Crafting — Shaped):**

| | Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| | | Ego soul | |
| Obsidian | Crafting Table | Obsidian |
| | Netherite Ingot | |

**Result**: Cursed Crafting Table × 1

> Place it down and right-click to open interface.

---

| Component | Description |
|------------|--------|
| **Soul Area** | 10 slots on the left show souls (gray = empty, purple = charged) |
| **⚡ Charge Button** | Sacrifice 1 Tier to charge soul |

## Soul System

Each Cursed Table holds max **10 souls**.
Souls are consumed when forging [cursed recipes](/en/items/cursed-recipes).

### Charging Soul

1. Click **⚡ Charge Soul** button
2. You lose **1 Tier** and suffer **1.5 hearts damage**
3. An empty soul slot is filled

> *"Every soul charged is a part of your ego you will never get back."*

### Consuming Soul

Each recipe requires a certain number of souls. When retrieving the result, souls are **devoured** — non-refundable.

## Abyssal Forging

This is a special forging mechanism for **High-level Relics** (Mace, Ego Shards...).
Unlike normal crafting, Abyssal Forging is a **gamble with time**.

### Process

1. Place materials in 3×3 grid
2. If recipe is valid → result appears
3. Click result → **forging process starts** (cannot cancel)
4. Wait for time to complete → take product

### Forging Characteristics
- ⏳ **Time**: Powerful Relics need extended forging time (5–10 minutes)
- 📍 **Exposed**: Forge location is **broadcasted to the whole server** — you become prey
- 🔒 **Locked**: Item is locked until completion
- 💀 **Risk**: forged items cannot be stored, can only be **absorbed** (strict-mode)

> *"Creations of the abyss cannot be crafted in ordinary ways. They need time, and a gamble."*
