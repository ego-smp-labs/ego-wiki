# Void Altar

The **Void Altar** is an ancient and malevolent structure. Unlike regular crafting tables, the Altar does not provide a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for crafting. Instead, you must manually **throw sacrificial items** into the void circle to perform rituals.

## 🏗️ How to Summon the Altar

The Altar cannot be crafted; it must be **summoned** using a multi-block structure.

1. Build a base using **8 Polished Blackstone Bricks** in a 3x3 square, leaving the center block empty.
2. Place a **Cursed Heavy Core** in the empty center space.
3. If the structure is valid, a lightning strike will occur, and the Altar will manifest as a purple hologram.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Once placed, the Heavy Core becomes bound to the world and cannot be broken or retrieved by normal means. Any attempt to destroy it will result in unforeseen consequences.

## 🩸 Blood Recharge Mechanic

The Altar requires "Life Energy" to function. Every newly summoned Altar (or after completing a ritual) has **5/5 Blood Charges**.

- Every time you successfully complete a ritual, the Altar consumes **1 Charge**.
- When the charges reach `0/5`, the Altar will **shut down** (the Hologram turns gray/red) and will no longer accept any items.
- **How to Recharge:** You must offer a real life. Bring a **Villager** near the Altar (within a 5-block radius) and **kill it**. The Altar will absorb the soul and fully recharge to `5/5 Charges`.

## 🎭 Ego Awakening Ritual

Every player has a limited Ego capacity (Tier 0 to 5). When you die, you lose your Tier. But if you crave a darker power...

1. Throw a normal **Ego** or a **Shattered Ego** into the center of the Altar.
2. The Altar will glow and absorb your Ego.
3. After a brief ritual, the Altar will return a **Dark Ego**.
4. This process consumes 1 Charge.

## ⚔️ Cursed Crafting

The Void Altar is the only place where you can forge **Cursed Weapons and Artifacts** (e.g., Sonic Boom shard, Hidden Blade, Memory Fragments).

### How it works
1. **Check recipes:** You can **Right-Click** the Altar with an *empty hand* to open a Preview GUI (Read-only). This interface is only for you to see what ingredients and quantities are required. You **cannot** click or place items into this UI.
2. **Perform the sacrifice:** Gather the required exact quantities of the items specified in the recipe.
3. Move close to the Altar, aim directly at the glowing beam, and **press the Drop key (Q)** to throw the items in.
4. The Void Altar will absorb the floating items around it (within a 3-block radius) and make them orbit the center.
5. When the system detects that the **exact and correct** ingredients for any recipe have been gathered, it will lock the Altar and begin the ritual (lasts 5 seconds).
6. Once the ritual concludes, the new item will be dropped. This consumes 1 Charge.

> 💀 **No Refunds:** Once you throw an item into the Altar and it begins to orbit, you **cannot get it back**. If you "accidentally" throw the wrong item, or if you break the Blackstone base mid-ritual to interrupt it, all floating items will be **swallowed by the void** forever. Be extremely careful!
