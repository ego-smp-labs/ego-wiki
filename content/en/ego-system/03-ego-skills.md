## Active Skills (Sin-Based)

Active skills are no longer tied to your tier. Instead, they come from the **Sin system**:

1. Awaken a sin to Level 2 using two Sin Hearts
2. Two skills are bound to your **Skill Slots** (hotbar)
3. Activate with `Shift + Right-Click` (Slot 1) or `Shift + Left-Click` (Slot 2)

Each of the 7 sins has a unique pair of skills. See the [Sins page](/ego-system/sins) for details.

## Curses (Tier 6+)

From **Tier 6** onwards, you bear curse effects:

| Effect | Starts From |
|--------|------------|
| Curse particles | Tier 6 |
| Glowing | Tier 7 |

## Inventory Shuffle (Chaos)

When using Ego/Dark Ego items, your **entire inventory** (both hotbar and inventory) will be shuffled.

## Item Stacking

Ego and Dark Ego items can be **stacked** (up to 16 per stack).
