## Dark Ego

At a certain level of strength (Tier 5+), your normal ego is no longer enough to satisfy you. You need something darker: **Dark Ego**.


### Origin
- **Dropped from where?**: Only dropped from players **Tier 5 and above**.
- **Rate**: **100%** (Always drops).

### Power
Dark Ego is not for the faint of heart.
- **Strength**:
  - **Tier < 5**: Randomly increase **+1-2 Tier**.
  - **Tier >= 5**: Increase **+1 Tier** (Required to use this item to level up).

## The price to pay:
  - **Death**: **10%** chance of **INSTANT DEATH** when used.
  - **Chaos**: Always active (cannot be skipped).
  - **Loss of reason**: Your **entire** inventory (hotbar + inventory) will be frantically shuffled.
  - **Effect**: Wither II, Darkness, Slow, Weak, **Nausea**.

  - Dark Ego is an ego that cannot be absorbed easily
