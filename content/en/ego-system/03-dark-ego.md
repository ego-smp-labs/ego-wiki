## Dark Ego

At a certain level of strength (Tier 5+), your normal ego is no longer enough to satisfy you. You need something darker: **Dark Ego**.


### Origin

- **Natural drop**: From a **Tier 5+** player when defeated (100%)
- **Craft**: Use [Tainted Ego](/en/items/ego-items#tainted-ego) as a core ingredient at the [Cursed Crafting Table](/en/items/cursed-crafting).

### Power

- **Tier &lt; 5**: Instant random increase **+1-2 Tier**
- **Tier &gt;= 5**: Increase **+1 Tier** (required to level up)

### The price

- **10%** chance of instant death upon use
- **Chaos**: The entire inventory is disturbed
- **Effect**: Wither II, Darkness, Slow, Weak, Nausea

> Dark Ego is the ego that cannot be absorbed easily.

## Dark Ego Purification

If you don't want to take the risk, you can **purify** your Dark Ego with a **Purification Stone**.

- **Formula**: Dark Ego + Purification Stone → Normal Ego Fragment
- **Purification Stone**: Forged from Amethyst Shard + Echo Shard at [Curse Table](/en/items/cursed-crafting)

> *"Darkness can be washed away — but purity has lost its original power."*
