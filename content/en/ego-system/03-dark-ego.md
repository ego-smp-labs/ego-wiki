<ItemCard id="dark-ego" name="Dark Ego" image="/wiki/items/ego_dark.png" rarity="mythic">

At a certain power threshold (Tier 5+), normal ego is no longer enough to satisfy you. You need something darker: **Dark Ego**.

</ItemCard>

- **Crafting**: Use [Tainted Ego](/en/wiki/items/ego-items#tainted-ego) as core material at [Cursed Crafting Table](/en/wiki/items/cursed-crafting) — **not used directly**.

### Power

- **Tier < 5**: Instantly increase random **+1-2 Tiers**.
- **Tier >= 5**: Increase **+1 Tier** (required for promotion).

### The Price

- **10%** chance of instant death upon use.
- **Chaos**: Entire inventory shuffled.
- **Effects**: Wither II, Darkness, Slowness, Weakness, Nausea.

> Dark Ego is an ego that cannot be absorbed easily.

## Purifying Dark Ego

If you don't want to accept the risk, you can **purify** Dark Ego using a **Purification Stone**.

- **Formula**: Dark Ego + Purification Stone → Normal Ego Fragment
- **Purification Stone**: Forged from Amethyst Shard + Echo Shard at [Cursed Table](/en/wiki/items/cursed-crafting)

> *"Darkness can be cleansed — but purity has lost its primal power."*
