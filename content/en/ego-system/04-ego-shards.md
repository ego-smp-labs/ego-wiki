# Ego Shard Slots

> *"Every shard is a piece of a soul torn apart. Fit them together —
> and you will become something that is no longer human."*

Shard Slots are two special positions in your inventory that allow you to equip
**Ego Shards** and gain combat effects. Each shard is the remnant of a **real ego** —
not a legend, but a memory imprisoned inside matter.

---

## Unlocking

| Tier | Slots Unlocked |
|------|-----------|
| &lt; 3  | None 🔒 |
| 3 – 4 | **1 slot** (Slot 1 — left) |
| 5+   | **2 slots** (Slot 1 + Slot 2) |

- Locked slot → displays **red glass** 🔒 (cannot interact)
- Unlocked but empty → displays **gray glass**

---

## Activation

| Slot | Keybind |
|------|---------|
| Slot 1 (left) | **SHIFT + LEFT CLICK** |
| Slot 2 (right) | **SHIFT + RIGHT CLICK** |

> ⚔️ **Active Shards** require holding a **melee weapon**
> (sword, axe, mace) to activate.
> **Passive Shards** are always active when equipped, regardless of slot position.

---

## Equipping

- **Right-click** with a Shard in your hand to equip it.
- If a slot is already occupied, you will be asked if you want to replace it.
- If **both slots are full**: **sneak + right-click** to choose slot 1, **sneak + shift+right-click** for slot 2.
- Shard in **Slot 1** → triggers with **Shift + Left Click**.
- Shard in **Slot 2** → triggers with **Shift + Right Click**.
- Shards **cannot** be placed in chests, barrels, shulkers, or any container (auto-dropped).
- To **unequip**: open `/ego` and click the shard slot.

---

## Uniqueness Rule

Each Shard type exists only **ONE AND ONLY ONE** across the entire server.

- The shard holder becomes a **hunted target**
- When the holder dies → shard **vanishes permanently** (no drop)
- After death → the shard can be **reforged** at the Cursed Crafting Table
- Reforging **broadcasts location** to all players on the server

### 🗡️ Shard of the Hidden Blade

> *"My body is covered in scars — but my eyes have never once gone dark.
> Every wound on my flesh... is a wound that should have been someone else's."*

The Hidden Blade was a warrior who could not be defeated — not because he was strong,
but because every blade that touched him **shattered on his skin**.
People say his true weapon was never the sword in his hand —
it was the **surface of his own body**.
He didn't die in battle. He died in his sleep,
hand still wrapped tight around his sword as if afraid someone might take it.

**Effect (Passive)**: Reflects **15%** of incoming melee damage back to the attacker.

### 🩸 Shard of the Bloodwolf

> *"People fear me when I'm almost dead.
> Because they know — that's when I'm truly alive."*

No one knows his real name. They only called him the **Bloodwolf**.
The closer to death he came, the more dangerous he became.
Soldiers didn't fear him when he was healthy —
they feared him **when he was dying**, because that was when his eyes lit up like fire
and everything he touched **broke three times harder**.
He died when he ran out of enemies to fight.
No more reason to keep existing.

**Effect (Passive)**: When HP drops below **30%**, each incoming hit has a **30% chance**
to activate: deal **+200% damage** for **5 seconds**
*(custom damage multiplier — not a potion effect, cannot stack)*.

### 🌑 Shard of the Nameless

> *"I'm not hiding. I'm not running.
> I simply... no longer exist in your eyes."*

The Nameless did not have his identity erased by history — he **erased it himself, first**.
Not invisibility in the conventional sense, but the ability to
**withdraw his presence from the perception of others** —
no one remembered his face, no one heard his voice,
no one could feel him in the same room.
He sat in a crowded court, watched the king strip everything from him,
and smiled — because he knew a day would come when he would need to disappear completely.
In the end, he walked out in broad daylight. Nobody noticed.

**Effect (Active)**: On activation → **Full Invisibility for 5 minutes**.
Cooldown: **10 minutes** after the effect ends.

### 🌘 Shard of the Phantom

> *"I was never here. I was never here.
> But you're already dead."*

The Phantom was the only assassin whose face **no one ever saw**.
His victim list was longer than any executioner in recorded history —
yet there were no surviving witnesses.
People say he didn't move through space —
he moved **through shadows**.
He vanished from history in the most literal sense.
No grave. No name. Only the remnant of an ego that was
cold as midnight and fast as death itself.

**Effect (Active)**: Dash **8 blocks** forward + gain **Invisibility for 3 seconds**.
Cooldown: **20 seconds**.

### 💀 Shard of the Mad Echo

> *"This scream is not meant for you to hear.
> It's meant to push you away."*

The Mad Echo lost everything in a single night — family, honor, sanity.
He stood in an empty battlefield and **screamed** — not a human sound,
but the voice of something that had given up on being human.
Every enemy around him was blown away like dry leaves before a storm.
People didn't kill him. They couldn't get close enough.
In the end, he died in silence — the one thing he had never chosen for himself.

**Effect (Active)**: Release a shockwave that sends all nearby enemies flying
within a **5 block radius**. Cooldown: **30 seconds**.

| | Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Row 1 | Sculk Shrieker ×1 | Echo Shard ×10 | Sculk Shrieker ×1 |
| Row 2 | Echo Shard ×10 | **Tainted Ego** | Echo Shard ×10 |
| Row 3 | Sculk Shrieker ×1 | Echo Shard ×10 | Goat Horn ×1 |

- **Souls**: 1 · **Forge time**: 5 min · *Location revealed*

### ☁️ Shard of the Sky Tyrant

> *"The ground beneath me is the thing I despise most.
> I don't belong here. I belong somewhere higher."*

The Sky Tyrant was an emperor who refused to bow — not even to the sky itself.
He built towers so tall that clouds parted around them.
When the towers collapsed under the weight of his arrogance,
he didn't fall down — he was **launched upward**,
as if the earth itself refused to receive him.
People searched for his body and never found it.
Perhaps he is still somewhere up there —
or perhaps he finally reached something no one else dared to dream of.

**Effect (Active)**: Launch yourself **10 blocks** straight into the air instantly.
Cooldown: **45 seconds**.

| | Col 1 | Col 2 | Col 3 |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Row 1 | Wind Charge ×10 | Slime Ball ×10 | Wind Charge ×10 |
| Row 2 | Slime Ball ×10 | **Tainted Ego** | Slime Ball ×10 |
| Row 3 | Wind Charge ×10 | Slime Ball ×10 | Wind Charge ×10 |

- **Souls**: 1 · **Forge time**: 5 min · *Location revealed*
