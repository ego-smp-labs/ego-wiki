# The Seven Deadly Sins

The Sin System is an advanced progression layer, offering passive effects and powerful active skills.

## How it Works

1. **Obtain Sin Heart** — craft at Cursed Table or receive from special event.
2. **Right-click** heart to **awaken** sin at **Level 1** (passive + downside).
3. **Right-click again** with same type to **upgrade to Level 2** (unlock active skills).
4. Using a heart of **different type** will **replace** the current sin completely.

## The Seven Sins

| Sin | Color | Theme |
|-----|------|--------|
| Pride | &e Yellow | Transcendence, overwhelming power |
| Greed | &a Green | Hoarding, increased items |
| Wrath | &c Red | Rage, raw damage |
| Envy | &5 Purple | Coveting, stealing buffs |
| Lust | &d Pink | Temptation, life steal |
| Gluttony | &6 Orange | Hunger, regeneration |
| Sloth | &8 Gray | Sluggishness, defense for price |

## Levels

### Level 1 — Awakening
- **Passive**: Permanent effect when sin is active.
- **Downside**: Permanent negative effect (trade-off).
- Heart is consumed upon use.

### Level 2 — Mastery
- **Skill Slot 1**: Activate with `Shift + Right Click`.
- **Skill Slot 2**: Activate with `Shift + Left Click`.
- Both skills have cooldowns.
- Heart is consumed upon upgrade.

## Upon Death

- **Skills** in skill slots will be **destroyed** (do not drop).
- **Clearing sin** upon death is configurable by admin.

## Skill Slots

The hotbar has two dedicated **skill slots** that are locked when a sin is active. These slots contain sin skill items and cannot be moved.

> **Note:** Each sin has a distinct pair of skills. Skills are tied to the sin type, not Tier.
