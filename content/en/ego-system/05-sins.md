# The Seven Deadly Sins — Thất Đại Tội

The Sin system is an advanced progression layer that grants powerful passives and active skills.

## How It Works

1. **Obtain a Sin Heart** — crafted via the Cursed Table or dropped from special events
2. **Right-click** the heart to **awaken** the sin at **Level 1** (passive + drawback)
3. **Right-click again** with the same heart type to **upgrade to Level 2** (active skills unlocked)
4. Using a **different** sin heart **replaces** your current sin entirely

## The Seven Sins

| Sin | Color | Theme |
|-----|-------|-------|
| Pride | &e Gold | Superiority, overwhelming power |
| Greed | &a Green | Hoarding, increased loot |
| Wrath | &c Red | Fury, raw damage |
| Envy | &5 Purple | Covetousness, stealing buffs |
| Lust | &d Pink | Temptation, life drain |
| Gluttony | &6 Orange | Hunger, regeneration |
| Sloth | &8 Gray | Lethargy, defense at a cost |

## Levels

### Level 1 — Awakened
- **Passive**: A permanent effect while the sin is active
- **Drawback**: A permanent negative effect (trade-off)
- Heart item is consumed on use

### Level 2 — Mastered
- **Skill Slot 1**: Active skill activated with `Shift + Right-Click`
- **Skill Slot 2**: Active skill activated with `Shift + Left-Click`
- Both skills have cooldowns
- Heart item is consumed on upgrade

## On Death

- **Skills** equipped in skill slots are **destroyed** (not dropped)
- **Sin clearing** on death is configurable by the server admin

## Skill Slots

Your hotbar has two dedicated **skill slots** that are locked while a sin is active. These slots hold sin skill items and cannot be moved by the player.

> **Note:** Each sin has a unique pair of skills. The skills are bound to the sin type, not to your tier.
