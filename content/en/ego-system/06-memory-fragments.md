# Memory Fragments

The most powerful Shards cannot be created from tangible materials alone. Instead, you must re-experience the very sensation that eroded the souls of the **Great Sinners**.

By proving your resonance with their egos, you can harvest **Memory Fragments**, which are then fused into weapons.

## 🩸 Blood Wolf's Memory Fragment

*The Blood Wolf was once a creature of the deep forest, but a thirst for blood clouded his sanity. Now, he lingers in Chaos, endlessly drinking bottomless blood to heal a wound that will never close.*

### Summoning Method
1. The player must activate their Ego to enter the **Chaos** state.
2. While this state is active, the player must continuously use **10 Instant Health Potions**.
3. Consuming an excessive amount of healing potions in a short time resonates with the **Blood Wolf's thirst**, causing his Memory Fragment to drop at the player's location.
> **Note:** You can drink or splash potions, but you must finish before the Chaos duration ends (15 seconds).

## 🌪 Sonic Boom's Memory Fragment (Cuồng Thanh)

*The Loudest One was exiled to the deep Ancient City. His mind became one with the Sculk, creating deadly echolocation sounds that pierce the soul.*

### Summoning Method
1. You must seek out an area containing a **Sculk Shrieker**.
2. Activate your Ego to enter the **Chaos** state.
3. While in Chaos, the player must **die** within close proximity (5 blocks radius) of a Sculk Shrieker.
4. Your bloody death during Chaos will awaken the Shrieker. There is a **50% chance** the Shrieker will explode, shatter, and release the **Sonic Boom's Memory Fragment**.

## ⏳ Universal Cooldown Rules

The will of the Sinners is heavy and cannot be constantly abused.

> [!WARNING]
> All players on the server share a **3-Day (72 real-life hours) Global Cooldown** for each type of Memory Fragment!

- If you or someone else has just awakened the Blood Wolf's Memory Fragment, **no other player on the server** can use that method to drop it again until 3 days have passed.
- Independent queues: The cooldown for Blood Wolf and Sonic Boom are tracked separately.
