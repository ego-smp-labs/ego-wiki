# Ego (The Self)

**Ego** is power dropped from blood.
You can get stronger from it — but every time you touch Ego, you sign yet another line in the pact with the Abyss.

> See tier details: **[Tier System](./02-tier-system)**

## How does Ego drop?

Ego **drops from other players** when you kill them.
It is not a "reward", but a piece of sin still warm — something the world throws into your hands to test how much you can endure.

## Using Ego: "The Aftershock"

Using Ego is not just a click-to-buff action.
It is a wave crashing into your mind, dragging light and darkness over each other, forcing you to **struggle** with what has just awakened.

- **The Price**
  - **Death**: **5%** chance of **INSTANT DEATH** upon use.
  - **Chaos**: Always triggered (cannot be skipped).
  - **Insanity**: Your inventory will be frantically shuffled.
  - **Effects**: Poison II, Darkness, **Nausea**.

  - **Absorption**: A very small chance you will neutralize the ego without any consequences.

A small price to remind you that "Ego always takes back its share".

If you survive and do not collapse in chaos, your Ego will stabilize over time — the "self" is no longer as fragile as it was in the beginning.

## Ego Tier (0 → 9)
It measures **how deep you have sunk into the Abyss**.

Each tier is a deeper level of hell — and also a new threshold of power.

- Tier 0: Mortal, not yet ego-fied.
- Tier 1: Beginning of ego-fication (enough for the world to recognize you "have changed").
- Tier 9: Ultimate form — no longer "holding power", but "living with it".

(Tier benefits details in [Tier System](./02-tier-system).)

## Anti-farm: The Abyss hates abusers

EgoSMP does not encourage "farming new players like mobs".
The server has anti-farming rules to keep PvP quality — preventing it from becoming an Ego press machine.

Core principles:
- Killing too continuously may restrict Ego drops (anti kill-spam), to avoid abuse.
- **Tier Difference** affects drops: High Tier (> Tier 2) killing Tier 0 will **not drop Ego** to prevent farming.
- Specific rule example: when a Tier 3+ attacker kills a Tier 0 victim, **no Ego drops**.
- However, a **Tier 0 vs Tier 0** battle will **ALWAYS drop Ego**, ignoring anti-farm restrictions.

## What about Death?

Death does not "wipe away simple".
But it breaks the momentum of your dark evolution.

- When you die, your Tier is **reset to Tier 1** instead of falling back to Tier 0.
- The demotion/anti-farm system is configurable to keep the server fair and reduce abuse.
