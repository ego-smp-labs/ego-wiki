# Ego

**Ego** (or Self) is power dropped from blood.
You can get stronger thanks to it — but every time you touch Ego, you are signing another line in the contract with the abyss.

> See tier system details: **[Tier System](./02-tier-system)**

## How does Ego drop?

Ego **drops from other players** when you kill them.
It is not a "reward", but a piece of sin still hot — something the world throws into your hands to test how much you can endure.

## When using Ego: "Ego Aftershock"

Using Ego is not just clicking to get a buff.
It is a wave crashing into your head, pulling light and darkness over each other, forcing you to **resist** what has just awakened.

Accompanying effects:
- Poison, Nausea/dizziness, flickering light/dark, confusion, loss of sanity (items swapping places as if mocking you)

A small price to remind you that "Ego always takes back its share".

If you survive and don't collapse in chaos, your Ego will stabilize over time — "the self" is no longer as fragile as it was at the beginning.

## Ego Tier (0 → 9)
It measures **how deep you have sunk into the abyss**.

Each tier is a deeper layer of hell — and also a new threshold of power.

- Tier 0: Ordinary human, not yet ego-fied.
- Tier 1: Beginning of ego-fication (enough for the world to recognize you "have changed").
- Tier 9: Maximum form — no longer "holding power", but "living with it".

(Tier benefits details see in [Tier System](./02-tier-system) page.)

## Anti-farm: The abyss hates abusers

EgoSMP does not encourage "farming newbies like mobs".
The server has anti-farm rules to keep PvP quality — not turning into an Ego pressing machine.

Core principles:
- Killing too continuously may restrict Ego drops (anti kill-spam), to avoid abuse.
- **Tier Difference** will affect drops: High Tier killing Low Tier too much will **not drop Ego** to prevent farming.
- Specific rule example: when a Tier 5 attacker kills a Tier 0 victim, it **does not drop Ego** (while Tier 0 or Tier 1 killing Tier 0 under suitable rules may drop).

## What about death?

Death does not "wipe away sin".
But it breaks your evolution momentum.

- When dying, your Tier is **reset to Tier 1** instead of falling to Tier 0.
- Demotion/anti-farm system is something configurable to keep the server fair and reduce abuse.
