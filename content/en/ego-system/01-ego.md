# Ego (The Self)


**Ego** is power shed from blood.
You can grow stronger with it — but every time you touch Ego, you sign one more line into a contract with the abyss.


> See the full rank system: **[Tier System](./02-tier-system)**


## How does Ego drop?


Ego **drops from other players** when you kill them.
It’s not a “reward” — it’s a still-warm shard of sin, tossed into your hands to see how much you can carry before you crack.


## Using Ego: “Ego Aftershock”


Using Ego isn’t a simple click-and-buff.
It’s a surge that floods your mind, layering light and shadow on top of each other, forcing you to **withstand** what just woke up inside you.


- **The price you pay**
- **Death**: **5%** chance to **DIE INSTANTLY** on use.
- **Chaos**: Always triggers (cannot be bypassed).
- **Sanity loss**: Your inventory will be violently scrambled.
- **Effects**: Poison II, Darkness, **Nausea**.
- **Absorption**: A very small chance you’ll neutralize Ego with no consequences.


A small price — just to remind you:
“Ego always takes back what belongs to it.”


If you survive and don’t collapse into the chaos, your Ego stabilizes over time — the “self” becomes less fragile than it was at the start.


## Ego Tier (0 → 9)
It measures **how deep you’ve sunk into the abyss**.


Each tier is one more layer of hell — and also a new threshold of power.


- Tier 0: Ordinary human, not ego-touched.
- Tier 1: Ego awakening begins (enough for the world to notice you’ve “changed”).
- Tier 9: The extreme form — no longer “wielding power,” but “living with it.”


(For detailed perks per tier, see the [Tier System](./02-tier-system).)


## Anti-farm: the abyss hates abusers


EgoSMP doesn’t encourage the “grind newbies like mobs” playstyle.
The server has anti-farm rules to keep PvP sharp — not turn it into an Ego press machine.


Core principles:
- Killing too repeatedly can reduce/limit Ego drops (anti kill-spam), to prevent abuse.
- **Tier difference** affects drops: a high-tier (Tier &gt; 2) killing a Tier 0 victim will **not drop Ego** (anti-farm).
- Example rule: if a Tier 3+ attacker kills a Tier 0 victim, **no Ego drops**.
- However, **Tier 0 vs Tier 0** battles will **ALWAYS drop Ego**, bypassing anti-farm restrictions.


## What happens when you die?


Death doesn’t “erase sin.”
But it breaks your momentum — the dark evolution you were riding.


- On death, your Tier is **reset to Tier 1** instead of falling back to Tier 0.
- The demotion/anti-farm system is configurable to keep the server fair and reduce abuse.
