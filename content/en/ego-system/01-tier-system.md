# Tier System

## Overview

The Ego Tier System ranges from **Tier 0** (The Awakened) to **Tier 9** (The Immortal). Each tier grants permanent stat bonuses and unlocks passive abilities.

## Tier Table

| Tier | Name | Health Bonus | Damage Bonus | Passive Abilities |
|------|------|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| 0 | The Awakened | +0 HP | +0% | None |
| 1 | Ego Warrior | +2 HP | +2% | — |
| 2 | Chaos Hunter | +4 HP | +4% | Anti-farming on |
| 3 | Shadow Dominator | +6 HP | +6% | Soul Stealer |
| 4 | Harbinger of Doom | +8 HP | +8% | Speed I |
| 5 | Ego Master | +10 HP | +10% | Shadow Step, Dark Ego drops |
| 6 | Lord of Chaos | +12 HP | +12% | Titan Skin, Resistance I |
| 7 | Death Incarnate | +14 HP | +14% | Ambient Glow aura |
| 8 | Ego Deity | +16 HP | +16% | Berserk, Strength I |
| 9 | The Immortal | +18 HP | +18% | Abyssal Shriek |

## Formulas

- **Health Bonus** = Tier × 2 HP
- **Damage Bonus** = Tier × 2%
- **Skill Cooldown Reduction** = Higher tiers reduce active skill cooldowns

## Tier-Up Method

1. Kill a player → collect their **Ego Fragment**
2. Right-click the fragment → survive the Chaos State
3. **Dark Ego** (from Tier 5+) gives +2–3 tiers at low tier, +1 at high tier

## Tier Loss

When killed in PvP, you may lose a tier. Use a **Soul Keeper** to prevent this (one-time).
