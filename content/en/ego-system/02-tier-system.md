# Tier System


Tier isn’t a “level” you flex.
It’s your depth in the abyss: the higher you climb, the stronger you become — and the harder it is to live like a human.


This system has 10 milestones: **Tier 0 → Tier 9**. (Tier 9 is the cap.)


## Tier Names & Requirements


| Tier | Name | Bonus | Requirement to reach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Ordinary | +0% DMG / +0% HP | Starting state. You haven’t “heard” anything yet. |
| 1 | Awakened | +5% / +5% | Face your first fear: survive your first kill, endure the “panic” without dying. |
| 2 | Fracture | +10% / +10% | Absorb more Ego: prove this is no longer a “slip of the hand.” |
| 3 | Marked | +15% / +15% | Absorb more Ego: prove your own strength. |
| 4 | Blood Pact | +20% / +20% / + Speed 5% | Absorb more Ego: prove your own strength. |
| 5 | Gate of Sin | +25% / +25% / + Speed 10% | To reach Tier 6: you must possess **[Dark Ego](./04-dark-ego)**. From here on, the world starts speaking your name. |
| 6 | Domain | +30% / +30% / + Speed 10% / + Resistance I | To reach Tier 7: you must possess **[Dark Ego](./04-dark-ego)**. |
| 7 | Incarnation | +35% / +35% / + Speed 10% / + Night Vision / + Resistance I | To reach Tier 8: you must possess **[Dark Ego](./04-dark-ego)**. |
| 8 | King’s Seal | +40% / +40% / + Speed 15% / + Night Vision / + Strength I | To reach Tier 9: you must possess **[Dark Ego](./04-dark-ego)**. |
| 9 | Sin-Flesh | +45% / +45% / + Speed 15% / + Night Vision / + Strength II | Maximum tier. Here, there is no “leveling up” — only “not losing yourself.” |


## Manifestation & Side Effects (The Manifestation)


When Ego begins to seep into every fiber of your body, the sinner’s vessel starts to change:


- **Tier 5+ (Higher Realm)**: A blood-red seal appears beneath your feet — proof you’ve stepped one foot into the abyss.
- **Tier 7–9 (Godform)**: Your body starts to glow; the aura of something “above” can’t be hidden.
- **Tier 9 (Killing Intent, United)**: Your veins burn crimson, murderous pressure wrapping your whole body. At this point, you are the abyss made flesh.


### The Cost
Great power comes with madness you can’t fully control.


- **Tier 8**: 5% chance to fall into “Madness” after taking another life.
- **Tier 9**: 15% chance to go berserk. When the blood-hunger rises, reason is swallowed by instinct.


## Operation


The higher your Tier, the stronger you are — but don’t forget: the higher you stand, the easier you become a target, because this server runs on one law:
kill, or be killed.
