# Tier & Ego Strength

Tier is not for showing off.  
It is your **depth** in the abyss: the higher, the stronger — and the harder it is to live as a human being.

The system has **10 milestones**: Tier 0 → Tier 9 (maximum).  
Each tier unlocks bonus powers, but also entails **curses** and **physical manifestations** of blackening.

## 📊 Tier Progress Table

| Tier | Name | HP Bonus | DMG Bonus | Speed ​​| Special |
|-------|---------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|
| 0 | **Mortal** | +0 | +0% | — | You haven't "heard" anything yet. |
| 1 | **Awakening** | +2 | +5% | — | Kill the first person. Overcome the "panic attack" without dying. |
| 2 | **Rift** | +4 | +10% | — | Absorb more Ego. Prove that this is no longer an "accident". |

> **Note:**  
> - From Tier 5 onwards, you are **required** to own **[Dark Ego](./dark-ego)** to be able to advance to the next tier.  
> - The higher the tier, the clearer the **seal**, **aura**, and **killing aura** are → you will become a hunting target.

## 🩸 The Manifestation

When the ego begins to creep into every fiber, the sinner's body will change:

### Tier 5+: Blood Seal
A red circle appears under your feet — proof that you have stepped one foot into the abyss.

### Tier 7+: Divine Transformation
The body began to **glow**, the aura of the superior could not be hidden.

### Tier 9: Unified Killing Aura
Blood vessels turned **blazing red**, murderous aura covered the entire body.  
At this moment, you are the **embodiment of the abyss**.

## ⚠️ The Cost

With great power comes uncontrollable madness.

| Tier | Insanity Rate | Description |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **Tier 8** | **5%** | After each kill, there is a 5% chance of falling into a "Mad" state. |
| **Tier 9** | **15%** | When bloodlust increases, reason will be swallowed up by instinct. |

> *"The stronger you are, the easier it is to lose yourself."*

## 💀 Lose Tier Upon Death

By default, tiers are only reset when you are **killed by another player** (PvP).  
Dying from mobs, falling, lava, or any other cause **does not** result in losing tiers.

> *"Only betrayal among your fellow human beings can pull you from the abyss."*

### Rules:
- ✅ Directly attacked by a player → **lose tier**
- ✅ Shot by arrows/projectiles from players → **lose tier**
- ❌ Death from mobs, falls, fire, etc. → **keep the same tier**
- 🛡 Use **[Soul Keeper](./ego-items#soul-keeper)** → **protect tier** no matter how you die

## 🔥 Active Skills (From Sin System)

Active skills **no longer tied to tier**.  
Instead, they come from **[Sin System](./sins)**.

### How to Unlock:
1. Awaken **Sin** to **Level 2** with **two Sin Hearts** (Sin Hearts).
2. Two skills are attached to the **Skill Box** (hotbar).
3. Activate with:
   - `Shift + Right Mouse` → Skill Box 1
   - `Shift + Left Mouse` → Skill Box 2

Each of the **7 types** of sins has its own pair of skills.  
See page **[The Seven Deadly Sins](./sins)** for details.

## 🌑 Curse (Tier 6+)

From **Tier 6** onwards, you are subject to curse effects:

| Effects | Starting From |
|-----------|-----------|
| **Curse Seed** | Tier 6 |
| **Glow** | Tier 7 |

> This is the sign of the abyss — it cannot be hidden, it cannot be escaped.

---

## 🎲 Chaos

When using items **[Ego](./ego-items)** or **[Dark Ego](./dark-ego)**:
- **Entire inventory** (both hotbar and inventory) will be **randomly shuffled**.
- This is a reminder that: power always comes with loss of control.

---

## 📦 Stack Items

**Ego** and **Dark Ego** can **stack** (maximum **16 per tile**).  
Save bag space, but don't overdo it — every use counts.
