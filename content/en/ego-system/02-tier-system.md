# Ego Tier & Power

Tier is not a trophy.
It is your **depth** in the Abyss: the higher it is, the stronger you are — and the harder it is to live like a human.

The system has **10 milestones**: Tier 0 → Tier 9 (max).
Each tier unlocks power bonuses, but also drags along **curses** and **physical manifestations** of corruption.

## 🩸 Physical Manifestation

When the ego begins to seep into every fiber of flesh, the sinner's body changes:

### Tier 5+: Crimson Seal
A crimson circle appears beneath your feet — proof that you have stepped one foot into the abyss.

### Tier 7+: Incarnation
The body begins to **glow**, the aura of a superior being cannot be hidden.

### Tier 9: Unified Killing Intent
Veins turn **bright red**, killing intent covers the entire body.
At this point, you are the **embodiment of the Abyss**.

## ⚠️ The Cost

Great power comes with uncontrollable insanity.

| Tier | Insanity Chance | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Tier 8** | **5%** | After each kill, there is a 5% chance to fall into "Insanity" state. |
| **Tier 9** | **15%** | When bloodlust rises, reason is swallowed by instinct. |

## 💀 Losing Tier on Death

By default, tier is only reset when you are **killed by another player** (PvP).
Dying to mobs, falling, lava, or any other cause does **not** cause tier loss.

### Rules:
- ✅ Attacked directly by a player → **lose tier**
- ✅ Shot by arrow/projectile from a player → **lose tier**
- ❌ Die to mob, fall, fire, etc. → **keep tier**
- 🛡 Use **[Soul Keeper](/en/items/ego-items#soul-keeper)** → **protect tier** regardless of death cause
