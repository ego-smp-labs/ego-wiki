# Ego Tier & Power

Tier is not for showing off.
It is your **depth** in the abyss: the higher it is, the stronger you are — and the harder it is to live like a human.

The system has **10 milestones**: Tier 0 → Tier 9 (max).
Each tier unlocks power bonuses, but also drags along **curses** and **physical manifestations** of corruption.

## 📊 Tier Progression Table

> **Note:**
> - From Tier 5 onwards, you **must** possess **[Dark Ego](/en/ego-system/dark-ego)** to advance to the next tier.
> - The higher the tier, the clearer the **seal**, **aura**, and **killing intent** → you will become a hunted target.

## 🩸 Physical Manifestation

When the ego begins to seep into every fiber of flesh, the sinner's body changes:

### Tier 5+: Crimson Seal
A crimson circle appears beneath your feet — proof that you have stepped one foot into the abyss.

### Tier 7+: Incarnation
The body begins to **glow**, the aura of a superior being cannot be hidden.

### Tier 9: Unified Killing Intent
Veins turn into **bright red**, killing intent covers the entire body.
At this point, you are the **embodiment of the abyss**.

## ⚠️ The Cost

Great power comes with uncontrollable insanity.

| Tier | Insanity Chance | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------|
| **Tier 8** | **5%** | After each kill, there is a 5% chance to fall into "Insanity" state. |
| **Tier 9** | **15%** | When bloodlust rises, reason is swallowed by instinct. |

> *"The stronger you are, the easier to lose yourself."*

## 💀 Losing Tier on Death

By default, tier is only reset when you are **killed by another player** (PvP).
Dying to mobs, falling, lava, or any other cause does **not** cause tier loss.

> *"Only betrayal among kin is strong enough to pull you from the abyss."*

### Rules:
- ✅ Attacked directly by a player → **lose tier**
- ✅ Shot by arrow/projectile from a player → **lose tier**
- ❌ Die to mob, fall, fire, etc. → **keep tier**
- 🛡 Use **[Soul Keeper](/en/items/ego-items#soul-keeper)** → **protect tier** regardless of death cause

## 🔥 Active Skills (From Sin System)

Active skills are **no longer tied to tier**.
Instead, they come from the **[Sin System](/en/ego-system/sins)**.

### How to Unlock:
1. Awaken **Sin** to **Level 2** using **two Sin Hearts**.
2. Two skills are attached to the **Skill Slots** (hotbar).
3. Activate with:
   - `Shift + Right Click` → Skill Slot 1
   - `Shift + Left Click` → Skill Slot 2

Each of the **7 sins** has a unique pair of skills.
See **[Seven Deadly Sins](/en/ego-system/sins)** page for details.

## 🌑 Curses (Tier 6+)

From **Tier 6** onwards, you suffer cursed effects:

| Effect | Starts From |
|-----------|------------|
| **Cursed Particles** | Tier 6 |
| **Glowing** | Tier 7 |

> This is the mark of the abyss — cannot be hidden, cannot be outrun.

## 🎲 Inventory Chaos

When using **[Ego](/en/items/ego-items)** or **[Dark Ego](/en/ego-system/dark-ego)**:
- **Entire inventory** (both hotbar and bag) will be **randomly shuffled**.
- This is a reminder that: power always comes with loss of control.

---

## 📦 Item Stacking

**Ego** and **Dark Ego** can **stack** (max **16 per slot**).
Saves inventory space, but don't abuse — every use has a price.
