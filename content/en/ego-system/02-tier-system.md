# Tier System

Tier is not a "level" to show off.
It is your depth in the abyss: the higher, the stronger — and the harder to live like a human.

The system has 10 milestones: **Tier 0 → Tier 9**. (Tier 9 is max.)

## Tier Names and Conditions

| Tier | Name | Bonus | Condition to reach |
|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | Ordinary | +0% DMG / +0% HP | Initial state. You haven't "heard" anything yet |
| 1 | Awakened | +5% / +5% | Face the first fear: survive after the first kill, overcome "panic" without dying. |
| 2 | Fracture | +10% / +10% | Absorb more Ego: prove this is not "accidental" anymore. |
| 3 | Mark | +15% / +15% | Absorb more Ego: prove your own strength |
| 4 | Blood Pact | +20% / +20% / + Speed 5% | Absorb more Ego: prove your own strength |
| 5 | Gate of Sin | +25% / +25% / + Speed 10% | **To reach Tier 6: Must own Dark Ego.** From here, the world starts calling your name. |
| 6 | Territory | +30% / +30% / + Speed 10% / + Resistance I | **To reach Tier 7: Must own Dark Ego.** |
| 7 | Incarnation | +35% / +35% / + Speed 10% / + Night Vision / + Resistance I | **To reach Tier 8: Must own Dark Ego.** |
| 8 | King's Seal | +40% / +40% / + Speed 15% / + Night Vision / + Strength I | **To reach Tier 9: Must own Dark Ego.** |
| 9 | The Sin | +45% / +45% / + Speed 15% / + Night Vision / + Strength II | Max Tier. Here there is no "leveling up", only "keeping yourself". |

## The Manifestation

As the Ego binds with your flesh, your form begins to twist under its weight:

- **Tier 5+**: A crimson seal manifests beneath your steps — the first mark of the Abyss.
- **Tier 7-9**: Your body emits an ethereal glow, an aura of superiority that cannot be hidden.
- **Tier 9**: Your veins burn red as murderous intent (killing intent) fuses with your very being. You are now a living vessel of the Abyss.

### The Cost of Power

Great power demands a heavy price. The closer you are to the Abyss, the harder it is to remain sane.

- **Tier 8**: 5% chance to fall into **Madness** after a kill.
- **Tier 9**: 15% chance to lose control. When the bloodlust peaks, reason is consumed by instinct.

## Operation

Higher Tier is stronger, but don't forget: higher means easier to become a target, because this server lives by the rule "kill or be killed".
