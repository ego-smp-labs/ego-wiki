# Sacrifice

> *"Not everyone is worthy to touch the darkness. But darkness is always ready to touch you."*

Sacrifice is a special branch of items — born from soul offerings at the [Cursed Crafting Table](/en/wiki/items/cursed-crafting). They are not weapons, not armor. They are **catalysts** — things that unlock hidden power buried in the abyss.

Two categories exist:

---

## Sin Hearts — Trái Tim Tội Lỗi

> *"Seven sins. Seven hearts. Each one beats with the rhythm of hell."*

Sin Hearts are items used to **awaken a Sin** — the dark power system tied to the ego.

### The Seven Hearts

| Heart | Sin | Awakening Effect |
|-------|-----|-----------------|
| Heart of Pride | Pride | Damage resistance when HP is high, reflective mirror |
| Heart of Greed | Greed | +15% drop rate, stealing, absorption |
| Heart of Wrath | Wrath | +damage when low HP, ground slam, ignite |
| Heart of Envy | Envy | Blink teleport, position swap |
| Heart of Lust | Lust | Slow, pull + blind, lifesteal |
| Heart of Gluttony | Gluttony | Buff on eating, feast strength, cleanse |
| Heart of Sloth | Sloth | Resistance while standing still, AoE slow, hibernate |

### How to Use

1. **Hold** the Sin Heart in your hand
2. **Right-click** to awaken the corresponding sin
3. Use the **same heart type** again → **upgrade to Level 2** (active skills unlocked)

### Current Status

> ⚠️ **Sin Hearts are currently disabled from the Cursed Forging system.**
> They can only be granted by an Admin. This is a gameplay balance decision.
